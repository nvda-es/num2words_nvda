# [Number to words](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/num2words) for NVDA

Author: Mateo Cedillo

## Introduction:

I was inspired to make this little add-on, because some people use speech synthesizers like `ETI-Eloquence` which has some flaws when it comes to number processing, even if they are separated and confuses the user saying both numbers separated by spaces as if it were a decimal point. 

This add-on improves the reading of numbers to words for these cases, it supports larger numbers and, in addition, the library supports many languages.

## Usage:

For now, the add-on has an unassigned input gesture. This is so that the user can customize them from the `NVDA menu/preferences/input gestures` dialog and avoid as much possible interference with some add-ons.

### functions:

* Toggle numbers to words : By activating this function, the text that NVDA speaks, (as long as it has numbers, or text and numbers) will be converted.

* More features soon.

#### note:

* As the library supports many languages, keep in mind that the conversion is done in the language of your speech synthesizer.
